    <h2>Delicouse Ramp Omelete</h2>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons grated Cheddar cheese, or to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ramps-leaves washed, dried, and finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine eggs, salt, and pepper in a bowl and whisk until foamy. Mix in Cheddar cheese and ramps</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a small skillet over medium-low heat. Pour in egg mixture and let cook for 30 seconds. Lift the edges of the omelet so that the uncooked egg runs under the cooked edges and comes into contact with the hot skillet. Shake and tilt the skillet to move the uncooked egg. Repeat until the top is set, about 5 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side until lightly browned, about 2 minutes</li>
    </ol>
